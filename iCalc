#This is a simple calculator to figure the tip amount per your meal. 
#This is somewhat a work in progress, and mainly copied via various tutorials in attempts to learn the basics


meal = 32.50
tax = .075  
tip = 0.15

meal = meal + meal * tax
total = meal + meal * tip


#Not sure why here:
print("%.2f" % total)
